            <h2>1. Calculator in Java</h2>
            <p>This project is a functional calculator application developed using Java and XML. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Challenges Faced:</strong> One challenge was ensuring that the calculations were accurate and handling different user inputs correctly. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Beginner-Friendly Aspects:</strong> This project is beginner-friendly because it introduces fundamental programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, and basic GUI (Graphical User Interface) design. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Java, XML
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Skills Developed:</strong> Working on this project improved my understanding of object-oriented programming and event-driven programming principles.

            <h2>2. To-Do List App</h2>
            <p>The To-Do List App is a simple yet effective application built with Android Studio using Kotlin. It allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, helping them manage their daily activities efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Challenges Faced:</strong> I encountered challenges related to data persistence, ensuring that tasks remain saved even when the app is closed. I used local storage techniques to resolve this issue.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Beginner-Friendly Aspects:</strong> This project provides a hands-on introduction to Android development and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. It's an excellent way for beginners to grasp the fundamentals of mobile app development.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Kotlin, Android Studio
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Skills Developed:</strong> Through this project, I learned about user interface design, data handling, and application lifecycle management in Android.

            <h2>3. Snake Game in Python</h2>
            <p>I created a fun and interactive snake game using Python. The game involves navigating a snake to collect food while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself. The more food the snake eats, the longer it becomes.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Challenges Faced:</strong> The biggest challenge was implementing collision detection and ensuring that the game mechanics functioned smoothly. It required careful planning of the game's logic and user inputs.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Beginner-Friendly Aspects:</strong> This project is beginner-friendly because it introduces game development concepts in a straightforward manner. It allows beginners to experiment with loops, conditionals, and event handling.
            </p>

    <h2>Upcoming Projects</h2>
    <p>I am excited to work on new projects that will further develop my skills in web and app development. Here are a few ideas Iâ€™m considering:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A personal blog website using Node.js and Express.</li>
        <li>An e-commerce application that allows users to browse and purchase products.</li>
        <li>A weather application that fetches data from an external API.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Stay tuned for more updates!</p>
