            Hello! I'm <strong>Rohan</strong>, a passionate <strong>Computer Software Engineer</strong> from <strong>Barrie</strong>. 
            I am 28 years old and have a keen interest in technology and programming. 
            My journey in software engineering began when I started building websites and applications. I love the challenge of creating user-friendly interfaces and solving complex problems through code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years, I've gained proficiency in several programming languages, including Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Kotlin, and Android Studio. 
            I have worked on several projects, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Calculator in Java</strong>: A functional calculator application developed using Java and XML, featuring graphics for a better user interface.</li>
            <li><strong>To-Do List App</strong>: A simple yet effective to-do list application built with Android Studio, allowing users to manage their tasks efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Snake Game in Python</strong>: A fun and interactive snake game created using Python, showcasing my programming skills and game development knowledge.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Looking ahead, I aim to continue growing as a developer and take on more challenging projects. I’m particularly excited about exploring new technologies and enhancing my skills in mobile application development.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I’m not coding, I enjoy listening to music and cycling. These hobbies allow me to unwind and recharge my creativity, which I believe is essential for anyone in the tech industry.
        </p>
